          Section 1 - Terms and Conditions related to our Learning Division of Excelsior.
        </h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The website <a href="https://getexcelsior.com/">getexcelsior.com</a> (referred to as the “company”) and the information, services and other materials contained therein are provided and operated by Excelsior. Infotech Pvt. Ltd. (referred to as “we”, “us” or “Excelsior.”). Excelsior offers curated and specially designed higher education and industry-relevant diploma and certification programs online (“Programs”).
          </p>
          <p>
            Please go through our Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy and other relevant documents available on the Platform (collectively referred to as the “Terms”) that govern the use of the Platform and Programs. Each Program may have a separate set of terms dealing with refunds, deferrals, payments, etc. governing such Programs, and our corporate clients may have executed separate written agreements with us, which, in the event of a conflict, will supersede these Terms to the extent of the conflicting provisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms shall apply to Facebook groups, Instagram pages, Facebook pages, email/SMS/phone communications and other social media forums hosted by Excelsior, which shall be deemed to be part of the ‘Platform’ by reference. You acknowledge that certain parts of the Platform, as mentioned above, are provided by third-party service providers, and you agree to abide by their terms and conditions. Excelsior shall not be responsible for any disruption of services caused by such third-party service providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that the use of the Platform and Programs constitutes an unconditional agreement to follow and be bound by the Terms. Although you may "bookmark" a particular portion of the Platform and thereby bypass these Terms, your use of the Platform still binds you to these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may change these Terms from time to time without prior notice. You should review this page regularly. Your continued use of the Platform and Programs after changes have been made will be taken to indicate that you have read and accepted those changes. You should not use the Platform or Programs if you are not happy with any changes to these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Excelsior makes no representations that the Platform operates (or is legally permitted to operate) in all geographic areas, or that the Platform, or information, services or products offered through the Platform are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Accessing the Platform from territories where the Platform, or any content or functionality of the Platform or its portions thereof is illegal, is expressly prohibited. If you choose to access the Platform, you agree and acknowledge that you do so on your own initiative and at your own risk and that you are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws.

          <h3>User Conduct Policy</h3>
          <p>
            Whether you have enrolled in a Program or are simply browsing the Platform, once you have accessed the Platform or Programs, you shall be considered a ‘user’ for the purpose of these Terms. You are responsible for all your activities in connection with the use of the Platform and Programs. You hereby agree to fully comply with all applicable local, provincial, state, national and foreign laws, treaties and regulations in connection with such use. You shall not resort to any unethical practices while using the Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without limitation, you will not post or transmit, or cause to be posted or transmitted, any communication or solicitation or other "phishing", "pharming" or "whaling" message designed or intended to obtain password, account, personal information, confidential information or private information from any user of the Platform or any other third party whatsoever. However, if any such event does take place, Excelsior shall not be liable for any loss of data or if the user’s device, computer or any other property is compromised in any manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that Excelsior has the right to report any and all suspicious or illegal activity to the appropriate legal or police authorities without notice to you.
          </p>
          <p>During your use of the Platform and Programs, you will:</p>
{/*        <ul>
            <li class="font-light mb-4">Not harass other users, students, attendees, support agents or visitors;</li>
            <li class="font-light mb-4">Not create an atmosphere of disharmony, hostility within student groups;</li>

            <li class="font-light mb-4">Notify the instructors immediately if you become aware of any other user cheating or breaching these Terms, and comply with the requirements of the specific applicable code of conduct, if any, relating directly to a Program into which such user is enrolled.</li>

          <h3>User Accounts, User Registration and Delivery of Services</h3>
          <p>
            In order to participate in most Platform activities and to apply for a Program, you will need to register for a personal account (“User Account”) by providing an email address and a password that is unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon payment of the Program fees – in part or whole, depending on the Program – Excelsior shall deliver the terms of use of the Program and grant you access to the Program. The invoice may be provided to you along with the email confirmation or within two (2) months thereafter. This shall be proof of delivery against the successful payment of fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Owing to certain exceptional circumstances, if Excelsior has granted you access to a Program pending payment, and Excelsior does not receive payments within the stipulated time periods, Excelsior may, at its own discretion, withdraw your access to the Program without giving any prior notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree that you will never divulge or share access to your User Account with any third party for any reason. You also agree that you will create, use and/or access only one User Account, and that you will not use any User Account other than your own.
          </p>
          <p>
            In setting up your User Account, you may be prompted or required to enter additional information, including but not limited to your name and email address. Additional information may be required to confirm your identity. You understand and agree that all information provided by you is accurate, current and complete and that you will maintain and update your information to keep it accurate, current and complete. You acknowledge that if any information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we reserve the right to terminate your use of the Platform and your enrolment into a Program, to the extent applicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the registration process, as part of your use of the Platform or participation in the Programs, we may obtain certain information about you and your performance in the Programs. Some of this information may be Personally Identifiable Information. We may use, maintain and store this information to provide certain services to you now and in the future, and may share such information with our Educational Partners or third parties in conjunction with such services or for the purpose of marketing. For example, as further detailed in our Privacy Policy, we may share certain materials or information about you with third parties, including your grades/scores in our classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to the Programs is restricted to attendees or students who have specifically been granted access by Excelsior.
          </p>
          <p>By registering your User Account, you agree that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="font-light mb-4">You are registered for the Program only once and will not set up multiple User Accounts; and</li>
            <li class="font-light mb-4">You will abide by these Terms and any terms specific to the Program.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Additional requirements apply to Students and working professionals. As a Student or working professionals, in addition to the points above, you agree that you are registering with the intent to complete the assignments, if any, that are relevant and applicable to the Platform or Programs into which you have enrolled.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="py-4">
          <h3>Payment Terms and Refund Policy</h3>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by Excelsior, full payment for participation in a Program is required at the time of registration. In the case of Programs that include a trial window, such trial window shall be made available only after the full payment. During the trial window, upon a request by the Student, and to the satisfaction of Excelsior, we may choose to refund the Program Fees paid, subject to such charges as may be decided from time to time. Once the trial window has closed, there will be no refund allowed for any reason whatsoever.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is the sole responsibility of the user enrolling into a Program to check the accuracy of, and evaluate the suitability and relevance of, the Program elected. The enrolment into a Program is non-transferable.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make payment for any Program or to purchase any services or products offered by Excelsior through the Platform, you must have internet access and a current valid accepted payment method as indicated during sign-up ("Payment Method"). Excelsior does not store any of your credit card information or such other information restricted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for processing payment and has partnered with payment gateways for the payment towards the services. By using a third-party payment provider, you agree to abide by the terms of such a payment provider. You agree that in case Excelsior’s third-party payment provider stores any such information, Excelsior will not be responsible for such storage, and it will be solely at your discretion to allow the third party to store such information. Any loss of such information or any loss incurred by you due to the usage of such information will be solely a loss incurred by you, and Excelsior is in no way liable for any such losses and is neither responsible to reimburse / make good such losses in any manner whatsoever. You also agree to pay the applicable fees for the payments made through the Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Failure to pay may result in withdrawal of your access to a Program. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or exchange rates. Excelsior does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide to us at the time of enrolment/purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may cancel your enrolment at any time. No refund will be made once the payment (in part or whole) for a Program has been made. We do not provide refunds for the lack of usage or dissatisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have subscribed for a free trial, the free trial period will last for the period of time specified during your sign-up. Free trials may not be combined with certain other offers. If you have subscribed to a particular paid service or product within the last six (6) months, or if your Payment Method, physical address or email address has been associated with an account for that paid service, you are not eligible to receive a free trial for that service or product. If you begin your subscription with a free trial, you may be ineligible for certain features of a product or service during your free trial period.

          <h3>Use of Programs</h3>
          <p>
            Excelsior reserves the right to cancel or reschedule any Program or live lectures/webinars, or to alter, modify or rearrange the schedule of topics, as well as the point value or weight of assignments, tests, quizzes, exams, projects and other such evaluations of progress. You also understand that Excelsior, at its sole discretion, may limit, suspend, or terminate your use of the Platform or Programs and/or all Excelsior-provided services related to the Programs, such as access to Excelsior coaches or support services, evaluation services, or certifications. You also understand that Excelsior may modify or discontinue all services related to its Programs at its sole discretion. You agree that Excelsior shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed to obligate Excelsior to maintain and support the Platform or Programs or any part or portion thereof or any associated services.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you no longer wish to use any Program, you may terminate your participation by giving notice to Excelsior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants of Excelsior online live lectures and webinars shall be provided access to such classes via email. You agree not to share such access with any third party. If you are unable to attend an online live lecture/webinar, please provide Excelsior with prior intimation regarding this.
          </p>
          <p>
            You shall be exclusively responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services needed to connect to, access, receive or use the Platform, including, without limitation, hardware devices, software, and other internet, wireless, broadband, phone or other mobile communication device connection services.

          <h3>Educational Partners and Accreditation</h3>
          <p>
            Excelsior is NOT a University, but an education service provider, offering Programs in consultation with Indian and International universities, educational institutions, governmental authorities, NGOs, corporates, etc. (each an “Educational Partner”).
          </p>
          <p>
            Admission to the degree/diploma programs of an Educational Partner is separate from being accepted into and/or taking one or more Programs. You agree and acknowledge that nothing in these Terms or otherwise with respect to the use of the Platform or any Program (a) enrolls or registers you in an Educational Partner, or any other school, division, institute or program of or associated with an Educational Partner, and (b) allows you to access or use the resources or receive any benefits or privileges of any Educational Partner, beyond the Programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Excelsior may offer a credential or other acknowledgement for participants who have satisfactorily demonstrated mastery of the Program material. The decision to award any such credential acknowledgement to a given participant will be solely at the discretion of Excelsior. We may choose not to offer any credential or other acknowledgement for some Programs. Excelsior may decide at its sole discretion whether to provide a record concerning a participant’s performance in a Program. The format of any credential or other acknowledgement, and of any performance, provided by Excelsior relating to Programs will be determined by Excelsior at its sole discretion and may vary from Program to Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be awarded a certificate of successful completion of a Program (“Program Certificate”) upon fulfilling the criteria and requirements of Excelsior and its Educational Partners. You acknowledge that any such Program Certificate awarded may not be affiliated to any Educational Partner and may not stand in the place of a course taken with an Educational Partner or convey academic credit or certification for any Educational Partner.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will not receive academic credit from Excelsior or any other Educational Partner for taking a Program. If you are taking a Program for academic credit or certification as a student of, or otherwise through, an Educational Partner, any such credit or certification may only be awarded directly by the Educational Partner based on its own policies and procedures, and you may be required by that Educational Partner to be registered or enrolled with the Educational Partner in order to receive credit or certification; and, in any event, Excelsior will not have any authority or responsibility with respect to any award of academic credit or certification provided by an Educational Partner for a Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that any Program affiliated with an Educational Partner may be subject to the terms, policies and procedures of the applicable Educational Partner in addition to Excelsior’s Terms. Without limiting the foregoing, if you are a student registered or enrolled at, or are otherwise attending, an Educational Partner and are taking a Program for credit or certification through that Educational Partner, you acknowledge and agree that (a) the Educational Partner may have its own terms, policies or procedures regarding your eligibility to participate in the Program, your participation in the Program, the requirements or prerequisites for receiving credit or certification for the Program, and/or your educational or student records as they may relate to your participation and performance in the Program, and (b) your educational or student records are maintained by the Educational Partner, including for purposes of assigning credit or certification, and not Excelsior.
